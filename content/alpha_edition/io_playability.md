## External Power Source Description

So the recommended standard power solution will definitely be the PD power adapter comes with Alpha package, which is an official LattePanda adapter. However, Alpha is designed for embedded application, like robotics and projects. So an external power solution will be necessary:
1. 12 volts DC In - JST PH2.0-4P connector
2. External Lipo battery support - 10p connector (details to be updated)

### 12 volts DC In Introduction

The voltage range of Alpha power input connector is 7.4~15 volts. So if you're choosing the lipo battery, it should be 2~4 cells. The standard power source is 3A@12volts. The booting power is like 10 watts. And operation power is like 5 watts without much load.

## M.2 Interface

There are M.2 connectors on the LattePanda Alpha, one M key and one E key.

### M Key
The M key interface allows PCI-E X4 or SATA storage.
#### **Storage**
* M.2 NVMe SSD
* SATA III SSD

#### M.2 To PCI-E Adapter

A PCI-E adapter can be versatile, allowing you to add hardware typically dedicated for full size motherboards to a single board computer form factor. This includes cards such as desktop graphic cards.\
**Note: When using a PCI-E adapter only 4 lanes are usable.**

#### Cool topics in forum

### External GPU
There are several videos on Youtube where desktop graphic cards are used on the LattePanda. An example video can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKchBNFBeTE).

### E Key

The E key interface allows PCI-E X2, USB 2.0, I2C, or UART.

## NVMe SSD in E Key

It is possible to use NVMe SSD in the E key with this adapter [adapter](https://www.amazon.com/Sintech-NGFF-NVME-WiFi-Cable/dp/B07DZF1W55)

!!! question
    It's possible to extend 2nd network card and graphic card with converter card. And we trust there will be more m.2 products from the market, like movidius ai accelerator. Feel free to share your idea with us via this [github docs repo](https://github.com/LattePandaTeam/Docs).


## USB 3.0 Interface

This is the most common interface. All three are USB 3.0 which allows transfering data up to 5 Gbit/s (625 MB/s), 10 times faster than the USB 2.0 standard! Due to the large bandwith, LattePanda can connect more accessories such as RealSense camera and virtual reality headsets.

## USB-C Interface

There is a USB-C interface on the board, formally known as **USB Type-C**. It can be used as a 12V power Input or use a USB-C hub to expend more interface like DP, DVI, SD card socket, etc.

### USB C Hub

A USB Type C hub can be used with the LattePanda Alpha. This can expand the number of ports you can use off just one connector. This can include SD/MicroSD, ethernet, USB, HDMI, ethernet, and many other ports.

### RS232

The RS-232 standard had been commonly used in computer serial ports. Thanks to their simplicity and past ubiquity,it is also used in industrial machines, networking equipment, and scientific instruments where a short-range, point-to-point, low-speed wired data connection is required.
